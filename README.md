hello-world
===================

Hey, what's happening out there? I'm listening to some music on Spotify while I work on this. Anyway, this is my first forray into coding. I know a little bit about coding because I work in web analytics and I have to read and understand some .js files as well as just basic script on a web page. 

This hello-world file is being created in regards to my Data Science Coursera Project. Thanks for looking.
